    Algorithmic Problem Solving has played a crucial role in my research projects in analytical chemistry
  assignments:
    - title: GC/HPLC Retention Time Predictor
      link: "http://www.retentionprediction.org/"
      tagline: |
        _Retention projection is an extremely accurate way to predict LC/GC retention time, and has been used as a novel approach for compound identification / differentiation._
          - Retention Projection is a exceedingly collaborative and interdisciplinary research project that enables accurate calculation of liquid chromatographic retention times across labs and methods.
          - Used 20+ calibration compounds to accurately obtain thermodynamic parameters for each column, thereby to predict, identify, and differentiate isomers.
          - Backend functions and APIs were implemented in Java (prototyped in VBA) with a user-friendly interface. Open-sourced on Github."

    - title: Background / Reference - Free Cellular Imaging with Optically Modulatable Fluorescent Proteins (OMFP) and digital signal processing (DPS)
      link: "#hook"
      tagline: |
        _OMFPs are fluorescent proteins (FP) discovered by us, which show potentials in revolutionizing cellular imaging._
          - Developed and implemented innovative approaches to discover, understand, and connect experimental data from multiple sources programmatically. Extracted key information from overwhelming background noise.
          - True reference-free and background-free cell images are obtained by performing fast Fourier transform (FFT) on time-series cell fluorescence using in-house programs written in Python, Matlab, and Mathematica.

    - title: Optically Modulatable Fluorescent Protein Engineering
      tagline: |
        _OMFPs fluorescence intensity can be modulated by co-illumination with photons more red-shifted than fluorescence._
          - Used site-directed mutagenesis to engineer novel OMFPs based on intramolecular interactions from the chromophore and surroundings using computer-assisted 3D modeling.
          - Worked in a tremendously collaborative design / engineering team to implement and formalize experimental sequences. Achieved high time efficiency while kept the cost manageable.

    - title: Mathematical Modeling of Fluorescence Protein Photophysics
      tagline: |
        _Optical modulation and delayed fluorescence from OMFPs and other fluorophores can be simulated with tremendous fidelity._
          - Simulated fluorescence through multi-state models using rate matrices corresponding to the Jablonski diagrams. Obtained crucial photophysical parameters that are previously too onerous to assess.  
          - The simulation was accomplished using Python-based computation (Numpy and Pandas), optimization (Scipy), and visualization techniques (Matplotlib).
          - Adopted object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, resulting in versatile, coherent, and succinct code.
