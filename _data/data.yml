    Algorithmic Problem Solving has played a crucial role in my research projects in analytical chemistry
  assignments:
    - title: GC/HPLC Retention Time Predictor
      link: "http://www.retentionprediction.org/"
      tagline: |
        _Retention projection is an extremely accurate way to predict LC/GC retention time, and has been used as a novel approach for compound identification / differentiation._
          - Used 20+ calibration compounds to accurately obtain thermodynamic parameters for each column, thereby to predict, identify, and differentiate isomers.
          - Backend functions and APIs were implemented in Java (prototyped in VBA) with a user-friendly interface. Open-sourced on Github."

    - title: Background / Reference - Free Cellular Imaging with Optically Modulatable Fluorescent Proteins (OMFP) and digital signal processing (DPS)
      link: "#hook"
      tagline: |
        _OMFPs are fluorescent proteins (FP) discovered by us, which show potentials in revolutionizing cellular imaging._
          - Developed and implemented innovative approaches to discover, understand, and connect experimental data from multiple sources programmatically. Extracted key information from overwhelming background noise.
          - True reference-free and background-free cell images are obtained by performing fast Fourier transform (FFT) on time-series cell fluorescence using in-house programs written in Python, Matlab, and Mathematica.

    - title: Optically Modulatable Fluorescent Protein Engineering
      tagline: |
        _OMFPs fluorescence intensity can be modulated by co-illumination with photons more red-shifted than fluorescence._
          - Used site-directed mutagenesis to engineer novel OMFPs based on intramolecular interactions from the chromophore and surroundings using computer-assisted 3D modeling.
          - Worked in a highly collaborative design / engineering team to streamline and implement experiment sequences. Achieved high time efficiency while kept the cost manageable.

    - title: Mathematical Modeling of Fluorescence Protein Photophysics
      tagline: |
        _By implemententing _
          - Probing fluorescent protein photophysics, simulation with Python based modeling and data visualization techniques.
